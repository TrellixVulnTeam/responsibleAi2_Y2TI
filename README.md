## Inspiration
Its all about communication. We understand each other, when we speak the same language, but do we understand how chatbots respond?
## What it does
Has a conversation with you in isiZulu, so you can learn the language. Allows you to download the audio clip as well as a word cloud that will be used to guide future chatbot responses.
## How we built it
Set up Azure database, coded the functions inclusive of Azure translate, added them to a Django project and deployed it to an Azure app container.
## Challenges we ran into
My free trial of Azure had expired, I switched to the paid version. My partner had trouble with deployment due to the chatterbot module which was solved by forking, correcting and creating a wheel. Displaying the wordcloud png file after it was generated by the code was not able to be done. Stop gap was to allow downloading of the wordcloud image.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Persevering despite the challenges and limited spare time.
## What we learned
Alot about Azure's capabilities and options.
## What's next for I am because you are.
Once enough data is gathered from anonymous users, we can improve chatbot responses while at the same time maintaining transparency. We also plan to explore other South African languages.
